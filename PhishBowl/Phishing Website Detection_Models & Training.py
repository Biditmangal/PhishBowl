# # **Phishing Website Detection by Machine Learning Techniques**
# 
# *Final project of AI & Cybersecurity Course*

# ## **1. Objective:**
# A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models and deep neural nets on the dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measures and compared.
# 
# *This project is worked on Google Collaboratory.*<br>
# *The required packages for this notebook are imported when needed.*

# ## **2. Loading Data:**
# 
# The features are extracted and store in the csv file. The working of this can be seen in the 'Phishing Website Detection_Feature Extraction.ipynb' file.
# 
# The reulted csv file is uploaded to this notebook and stored in the dataframe.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# In[4]:


#Loading the data
data0 = pd.read_csv('./DataFiles/5.urldata.csv')
data0.head()


# ## **3. Familiarizing with Data**
# In this step, few dataframe methods are used to look into the data and its features.

# In[5]:


#Checking the shape of the dataset
data0.shape


# In[6]:


#Listing the features of the dataset
data0.columns


# In[7]:


#Information about the dataset
data0.info()


# ## **4. Visualizing the data**
# Few plots and graphs are displayed to find how the data is distributed and the how features are related to each other.

# In[8]:


#Plotting the data distribution
data0.hist(bins = 50,figsize = (15,15))
plt.show()


# In[9]:


#Correlation heatmap

plt.figure(figsize=(15,13))
sns.heatmap(data0.corr())
plt.show()


# ## **5. Data Preprocessing & EDA**
# Here, we clean the data by applying data preprocesssing techniques and transform the data to use it in the models.

# In[10]:


data0.describe()


# The above obtained result shows that the most of the data is made of 0's & 1's except 'Domain' & 'URL_Depth' columns. The Domain column doesnt have any significance to the machine learning model training. So dropping the *'Domain'* column from the dataset. 

# In[11]:


#Dropping the Domain column
data = data0.drop(['Domain'], axis = 1).copy()


# This leaves us with 16 features & a target column. The *'URL_Depth'* maximum value is 20. According to my understanding, there is no necessity to change this column.

# In[12]:


#checking the data for null or missing values
data.isnull().sum()


# In the feature extraction file, the extracted features of legitmate & phishing url datasets are just concatenated without any shuffling. This resulted in top 5000 rows of legitimate url data & bottom 5000 of phishing url data. 
# 
# To even out the distribution while splitting the data into training & testing sets, we need to shuffle it. This even evades the case of overfitting while model training.

# In[13]:


# shuffling the rows in the dataset so that when splitting the train and test set are equally distributed
data = data.sample(frac=1).reset_index(drop=True)
data.head()


# From the above execution, it is clear that the data doesnot have any missing values.
# 
# By this, the data is throughly preprocessed & is ready for training.

# ## **6. Splitting the Data**

# In[14]:


# Sepratating & assigning features and target columns to X & y
y = data['Label']
X = data.drop('Label',axis=1)
X.shape, y.shape


# In[15]:


# Splitting the dataset into train and test sets: 80-20 split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, 
                                                    test_size = 0.2, random_state = 12)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape


# ## **7. Machine Learning Models & Training**
# 
# From the dataset above, it is clear that this is a supervised machine learning task. There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called classification and regression. 
# 
# This data set comes under classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). The supervised machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this notebook are:
# * Decision Tree
# * Random Forest
# * Multilayer Perceptrons
# * XGBoost
# * Autoencoder Neural Network
# * Support Vector Machines

# ### **7.1. Decision Tree Classifier**
#  Decision trees are widely used models for classification and regression tasks. Essentially, they learn a hierarchy of if/else questions, leading to a decision. Learning a decision tree means learning the sequence of if/else questions that gets us to the true answer most quickly.
#  
# In the machine learning setting, these questions are called tests (not to be confused with the test set, which is the data we use to test to see how generalizable our model is). To build a tree, the algorithm searches over all possible tests and finds the one that is most informative about the target variable.

# In[18]:


# Decision Tree model 
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# instantiate the model 
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 5)
# fit the model 
tree.fit(X_train, y_train)


# In[19]:


#predicting the target value from the model for the samples
y_test_tree = tree.predict(X_test)
y_train_tree = tree.predict(X_train)

#computing the accuracy of the model performance
acc_train_tree = accuracy_score(y_train,y_train_tree)
acc_test_tree = accuracy_score(y_test,y_test_tree)

storeResults('Decision Tree', acc_train_tree, acc_test_tree)


# ### **7.2. Random Forest Classifier**
# Random forests for regression and classification are currently among the most widely used machine learning methods.A random forest is essentially a collection of decision trees, where each tree is slightly different from the others. The idea behind random forests is that each tree might do a relatively good job of predicting, but will likely overfit on part of the data.
# 
# If we build many trees, all of which work well and overfit in different ways, we can reduce the amount of overfitting by averaging their results. To build a random forest model, you need to decide on the number of trees to build (the n_estimators parameter of RandomForestRegressor or RandomForestClassifier). They are very powerful, often work well without heavy tuning of the parameters, and don???t require scaling of the data.

# In[25]:


# Random Forest model
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# instantiate the model
forest = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=5)

# fit the model 
forest.fit(X_train, y_train)


# In[26]:


#predicting the target value from the model for the samples

# ### **7.3. Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs): Deep Learning**
# Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are also known as (vanilla) feed-forward neural networks, or sometimes just neural networks. Multilayer perceptrons can be applied for both classification and regression problems.
# 
# MLPs can be viewed as generalizations of linear models that perform multiple stages of processing to come to a decision.

# In[31]:


# Multilayer Perceptrons model
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# instantiate the model
mlp = MLPClassifier(alpha=0.001, hidden_layer_sizes=([100,100,100]))

# fit the model 
mlp.fit(X_train, y_train)


# In[32]:

storeResults('Multilayer Perceptrons', acc_train_mlp, acc_test_mlp)


# ### **7.4. XGBoost Classifier**
# XGBoost is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms these days. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Regardless of the type of prediction task at hand; regression or classification. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.

# In[36]:


#XGBoost Classification model
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

# instantiate the model
xgb = XGBClassifier(learning_rate=0.4,max_depth=7)
#fit the model
xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)


# In[37]:


#predicting the target value from the model for the samples
y_test_xgb = xgb.predict(X_test)

# **Performance Evaluation:**

# In[38]:


#computing the accuracy of the model performance
acc_train_xgb = accuracy_score(y_train,y_train_xgb)
acc_test_xgb = accuracy_score(y_test,y_test_xgb)

print("XGBoost: Accuracy on training Data: {:.3f}".format(acc_train_xgb))

storeResults('XGBoost', acc_train_xgb, acc_test_xgb)


# ### **7.5. Autoencoder Neural Network**
# An auto encoder is a neural network that has the same number of input neurons as it does outputs. The hidden layers of the neural network will have fewer neurons than the input/output neurons. Because there are fewer neurons, the auto-encoder must learn to encode the input to the fewer hidden neurons. The predictors (x) and output (y) are exactly the same in an auto encoder.

# ### **7.6. Support Vector Machines**
# 
# In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

# In[46]:


#Support vector machine model
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# instantiate the model
svm = SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0, random_state=12)
#fit the model
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)


# In[47]:


#predicting the target value from the model for the samples
y_test_svm = svm.predict(X_test)
y_train_svm = svm.predict(X_train)


# **Performance Evaluation:**

# In[48]:

# ## **8. Comparision of Models**
# To compare the models performance, a dataframe is created. The columns of this dataframe are the lists created to store the results of the model.

# In[51]:


#creating dataframe
results = pd.DataFrame({ 'ML Model': ML_Model,    
    'Train Accuracy': acc_train,
